% Load an image into the MATLAB variable im by using the iread() function
% and supplying the file path as a string input argument.
im = iread('street.png');
%% 
% Display the image using the function idisp().
idisp(im)
%% 
% Now extract the metadata from the image file by provide two output
% arguments to the iread() function and display the data.
[im meta] = iread('street.png');

%% 
% Some elements of the structure are structures themselves and more
% information can be found. For example, have a look at the camera
% information

% meta.DigitalCamera

% The pixel value information can also be accessed directly by addressing
% the element. For example, the value at (u,v)-coordinate (562,653) can be
% found.
im(653,562)

% Notice that the indices have been reversed as comared to the coordinates.
% This is due to the indexing of matrices being (row, column) where images
% are described as (horizontal position, vertical position).
